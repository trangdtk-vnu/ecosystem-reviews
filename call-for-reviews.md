# 🤝 Call for Collaboration  
**Join the Ecosystem of Reviews for Carbon Pricing – Let’s Build Living Evidence Together!**

---

Dear colleagues,  

🌍 Be part of the **Ecosystem of Reviews for Carbon Pricing**!  
We’re building a collaborative platform to improve the quality and accessibility of reviews on carbon pricing — and we’re inviting you to join us!

This Ecosystem is an **integrated and dynamic framework** that encompasses systematic reviews, meta-analyses, and evidence maps, all interacting to provide comprehensive evidence on the effects of carbon pricing. It supports **robust, real-time policy decisions**, with a special focus on meta-analyses of **ex-post empirical evaluations** from a global perspective.  

> Our ambition is to turn systematic reviews and meta-analyses into **living evidence** — regularly updated and increasingly relevant as carbon prices evolve.
