# Call for Collaboration 

<p>
🤝 Join the Ecosystem of Reviews for Carbon Pricing – Let’s Build Living Evidence Together! 🤝
Dear colleagues,
🌍 Be part of the Ecosystem of Reviews for Carbon Pricing! 🌐
We’re building a collaborative platform to improve the quality and accessibility of reviews on carbon pricing - and we’re inviting you to join us! 
This Ecosystem is an integrated and dynamic framework that encompasses systematic reviews, meta-analyses, and evidence maps, all interacting to provide comprehensive evidence for the effects of carbon pricing, supporting robust, real-time policy decisions. The focus is on meta-analyses of empirical evaluations of the ex-post literature with a global perspective and the ambition to become living evidence. Turning systematic reviews and meta-analyses into living evidence is particularly indicated as carbon prices will change over time.
💡 How you can contribute:
Team Up on Reviews
 Work with others to co-author high-quality reviews as part of our coordinated ecosystem. We welcome new review proposals and collaborations on existing ones!


Contribute Existing Reviews
 Have you already conducted a review? Help harmonize it with our methodological framework and join the effort to turn it into living evidence - regularly updated and policy-relevant.


Contribute as an Individual
 Whether you're a student, early-career researcher, or expert - your contribution matters! Let us know what topic(s) you're interested in, and we’ll connect you with the right team.
✨ Why get involved?
 ✅ Collaborate with an interdisciplinary community
 ✅ Co-author impactful scientific outputs
 ✅ Shape a more transparent, dynamic, and policy-ready evidence base
